### A little bit about us

**Linda**:gemini:

I am from Latvia, Riga. I have 2 daughters and at the moment I'm trying to balance starting my youngest daughter's kindergarten, family, work, and the WoTech course + somewhere in between I still need to find time for rest 😄  I have no previous experience in programming and I feel that this course is challenging, but I'm optimistic about the end result. Of the two programming languages, I like Python :snake: more than Java.

Interest about IT started when I was on my second child's maternity leave - after I finished Riga TechGirls course Discover Tech in november of 2023. I started to think that it is time for something new and maybe to change my career to IT.

**Astrid**:taurus:

I live in Tartu, Estonia. I have learned Html/CSS and SQL but that was few years ago. Right now I'm interested in learning more and more about IT because I don't want to stay in comfort zone.

I also like video games and am currently playing Ghost of Tsushima :video_game:
